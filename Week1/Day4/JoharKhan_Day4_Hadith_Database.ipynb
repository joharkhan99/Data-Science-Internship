They were \\n     merchants doing business in Sham (Syria, Palestine, Lebanon and \\n     Jordan), at the time when Allah\\'s Messenger (ﷺ) had truce with Abu Sufyan \\n     and Quraish infidels. So Abu Sufyan and his companions went to \\n     Heraclius at Ilya (Jerusalem). Heraclius called them in the court and \\n     he had all the senior Roman dignitaries around him. He called for his \\n     translator who, translating Heraclius\\'s question said to them, \"Who \\n     amongst you is closely related to that man who claims to be a \\n     Prophet?\" Abu Sufyan replied, \"I am the nearest relative to him \\n     (amongst the group).\"\\n\\n\\n     Heraclius said, \"Bring him (Abu Sufyan) close to me and make his \\n     companions stand behind him.\" Abu Sufyan added, Heraclius told his \\n     translator to tell my companions that he wanted to put some questions \\n     to me regarding that man (The Prophet) and that if I told a lie they \\n     (my companions) should contradict me.\" Abu Sufyan added, \"By Allah! \\n     Had I not been afraid of my companions labeling me a liar, I would not\\n     have spoken the truth about the Prophet. The first question he asked \\n     me about him was:\\n\\n\\n     \\'What is his family status amongst you?\\' \\n\\n\\n     I replied, \\'He belongs to a good (noble) family amongst us.\\' \\n\\n\\n     Heraclius further asked, \\'Has anybody amongst you ever claimed the \\n     same (i.e. to be a Prophet) before him?\\'\\n\\n\\n     I replied, \\'No.\\'\\n\\n\\n     He said, \\'Was anybody amongst his ancestors a king?\\'\\n\\n\\n     I replied, \\'No.\\'\\n\\n\\n     Heraclius asked, \\'Do the nobles or the poor follow him?\\'\\n\\n\\n     I replied, \\'It is the poor who follow him.\\'\\n\\n\\n     He said, \\'Are his followers increasing decreasing (day by day)?\\'\\n\\n\\n     I replied, \\'They are increasing.\\'\\n\\n\\n     He then asked, \\'Does anybody amongst those who embrace his religion \\n     become displeased and renounce the religion afterwards?\\'\\n\\n\\n     I replied, \\'No.\\'\\n\\n\\n     Heraclius said, \\'Have you ever accused him of telling lies before his \\n     claim (to be a Prophet)?\\'\\n\\n\\n     I replied, \\'No. \\'\\n\\n\\n     Heraclius said, \\'Does he break his promises?\\'\\n\\n\\n     I replied, \\'No. We are at truce with him but we do not know what he \\n     will do in it.\\' I could not find opportunity to say anything against \\n     him except that.\\n\\n\\n     Heraclius asked, \\'Have you ever had a war with him?\\'\\n\\n\\n     I replied, \\'Yes.\\'\\n\\n\\n     Then he said, \\'What was the outcome of the battles?\\'\\n\\n\\n     I replied, \\'Sometimes he was victorious and sometimes we.\\'\\n\\n\\n     Heraclius said, \\'What does he order you to do?\\'\\n\\n\\n     I said, \\'He tells us to worship Allah and Allah alone and not to \\n     worship anything along with Him, and to renounce all that our \\n     ancestors had said. He orders us to pray, to speak the truth, to be \\n     chaste and to keep good relations with our Kith and kin.\\'\\n\\n\\n     Heraclius asked the translator to convey to me the following, I asked \\n     you about his family and your reply was that he belonged to a very \\n     noble family. In fact all the Apostles come from noble families \\n     amongst their respective peoples. I questioned you whether anybody \\n     else amongst you claimed such a thing, your reply was in the negative.\\n     If the answer had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that \\n     this man was following the previous man\\'s statement. Then I asked you \\n     whether anyone of his ancestors was a king. Your reply was in the \\n     negative, and if it had been in the affirmative, I would have thought \\n     that this man wanted to take back his ancestral kingdom.\\n\\n\\n     I further asked whether he was ever accused of telling lies before he \\n     said what he said, and your reply was in the negative. So I wondered \\n     how a person who does not tell a lie about others could ever tell a \\n     lie about Allah. I, then asked you whether the rich people followed \\n     him or the poor. You replied that it was the poor who followed him. \\n     And in fact all the Apostle have been followed by this very class of \\n     people. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or \\n     decreasing. You replied that they were increasing, and in fact this is\\n     the way of true faith, till it is complete in all respects. I further \\n     asked you whether there was anybody, who, after embracing his \\n     religion, became displeased and discarded his religion. Your reply was\\n     in the negative, and in fact this is (the sign of) true faith, when \\n     its delight enters the hearts and mixes with them completely. I asked \\n     you whether he had ever betrayed. You replied in the negative and \\n     likewise the Apostles never betray. Then I asked you what he ordered \\n     you to do. You replied that he ordered you to worship Allah and Allah \\n     alone and not to worship any thing along with Him and forbade you to \\n     worship idols and ordered you to pray, to speak the truth and to be \\n     chaste. If what you have said is true, he will very soon occupy this \\n     place underneath my feet and I knew it (from the scriptures) that he \\n     was going to appear but I did not know that he would be from you, and \\n     if I could reach him definitely, I would go immediately to meet him \\n     and if I were with him, I would certainly wash his feet.\\' Heraclius \\n     then asked for the letter addressed by Allah\\'s Apostle\\n\\n\\n     which was delivered by Dihya to the Governor of Busra, who forwarded \\n     it to Heraclius to read. The contents of the letter were as follows: \\n     \"In the name of Allah the Beneficent, the Merciful (This letter is) \\n     from Muhammad the slave of Allah and His Apostle to Heraclius the \\n     ruler of Byzantine.

Then I started to become sure that he (the Prophet) would be the \\n     conqueror in the near future till I embraced Islam (i.e. Allah guided \\n     me to it).\"\\n\\n\\n     The sub narrator adds, \"Ibn An-Natur was the Governor of llya\\' \\n     (Jerusalem) and Heraclius was the head of the Christians of Sham. Ibn \\n     An-Natur narrates that once while Heraclius was visiting ilya\\' \\n     (Jerusalem), he got up in the morning with a sad mood. Some of his \\n     priests asked him why he was in that mood? Heraclius was a foreteller \\n     and an astrologer. He replied, \\'At night when I looked at the stars, I\\n     saw that the leader of those who practice circumcision had appeared \\n     (become the conqueror). Who are they who practice circumcision?\\' The \\n     people replied, \\'Except the Jews nobody practices circumcision, so you\\n     should not be afraid of them (Jews).\\n\\n\\n     \\'Just Issue orders to kill every Jew present in the country.\\'\\n\\n\\n     While they were discussing it, a messenger sent by the king of Ghassan\\n     to convey the news of Allah\\'s Messenger (ﷺ) to Heraclius was brought in. \\n     Having heard the news, he (Heraclius) ordered the people to go and see\\n     whether the messenger of Ghassan was circumcised. The people, after \\n     seeing him, told Heraclius that he was circumcised. Heraclius then \\n     asked him about the Arabs. The messenger replied, \\'Arabs also practice\\n     circumcision.\\'\\n\\n\\n     (After hearing that) Heraclius remarked that sovereignty of the \\'Arabs\\n     had appeared. Heraclius then wrote a letter to his friend in Rome who \\n     was as good as Heraclius in knowledge. Heraclius then left for Homs. \\n     (a town in Syrian and stayed there till he received the reply of his \\n     letter from his friend who agreed with him in his opinion about the \\n     emergence of the Prophet (ﷺ) and the fact that he was a Prophet. On that \\n     Heraclius invited all the heads of the Byzantines to assemble in his \\n     palace at Homs. When they assembled, he ordered that all the doors of \\n     his palace be closed. Then he came out and said, \\'O Byzantines! If \\n     success is your desire and if you seek right guidance and want your \\n     empire to remain then give a pledge of allegiance to this Prophet \\n     (i.e. embrace Islam).\\'\\n\\n\\n     (On hearing the views of Heraclius) the people ran towards the gates \\n     of the palace like onagers but found the doors closed. Heraclius \\n     realized their hatred towards Islam and when he lost the hope of their\\n     embracing Islam, he ordered that they should be brought back in \\n     audience.\\n\\n\\n     (When they returned) he said, \\'What already said was just to test the \\n     strength of your conviction and I have seen it.\\' The people prostrated\\n     before him and became pleased with him, and this was the end of \\n     Heraclius\\'s story (in connection with his faith).\\n \\n\\n     Heraclius said, \"Bring him (Abu Sufyan) close to me and make his \\n     companions stand behind him.\" Abu Sufyan added, Heraclius told his \\n     translator to tell my companions that he wanted to put some questions \\n     to me regarding that man (The Prophet) and that if I told a lie they \\n     (my companions) should contradict me.\" Abu Sufyan added, \"By Allah! \\n     Had I not been afraid of my companions labeling me a liar, I would not\\n     have spoken the truth about the Prophet.

I further \\n     asked you whether there was anybody, who, after embracing his \\n     religion, became displeased and discarded his religion. Your reply was\\n     in the negative, and in fact this is (the sign of) true faith, when \\n     its delight enters the hearts and mixes with them completely. I asked \\n     you whether he had ever betrayed. You replied in the negative and \\n     likewise the Apostles never betray. Then I asked you what he ordered \\n     you to do. You replied that he ordered you to worship Allah and Allah \\n     alone and not to worship any thing along with Him and forbade you to \\n     worship idols and ordered you to pray, to speak the truth and to be \\n     chaste. If what you have said is true, he will very soon occupy this \\n     place underneath my feet and I knew it (from the scriptures) that he \\n     was going to appear but I did not know that he would be from you, and \\n     if I could reach him definitely, I would go immediately to meet him \\n     and if I were with him, I would certainly wash his feet.\\' Heraclius \\n     then asked for the letter addressed by Allah\\'s Apostle\\n\\n\\n     which was delivered by Dihya to the Governor of Busra, who forwarded \\n     it to Heraclius to read.

Who are they who practice circumcision?\\' The \\n     people replied, \\'Except the Jews nobody practices circumcision, so you\\n     should not be afraid of them (Jews).\\n\\n\\n     \\'Just Issue orders to kill every Jew present in the country.\\'\\n\\n\\n     While they were discussing it, a messenger sent by the king of Ghassan\\n     to convey the news of Allah\\'s Messenger (ﷺ) to Heraclius was brought in. \\n     Having heard the news, he (Heraclius) ordered the people to go and see\\n     whether the messenger of Ghassan was circumcised. The people, after \\n     seeing him, told Heraclius that he was circumcised. Heraclius then \\n     asked him about the Arabs. The messenger replied, \\'Arabs also practice\\n     circumcision.\\'\\n\\n\\n     (After hearing that) Heraclius remarked that sovereignty of the \\'Arabs\\n     had appeared. Heraclius then wrote a letter to his friend in Rome who \\n     was as good as Heraclius in knowledge. Heraclius then left for Homs. \\n     (a town in Syrian and stayed there till he received the reply of his \\n     letter from his friend who agreed with him in his opinion about the \\n     emergence of the Prophet (ﷺ) and the fact that he was a Prophet. On that \\n     Heraclius invited all the heads of the Byzantines to assemble in his \\n     palace at Homs. When they assembled, he ordered that all the doors of \\n     his palace be closed. Then he came out and said, \\'O Byzantines! If \\n     success is your desire and if you seek right guidance and want your \\n     empire to remain then give a pledge of allegiance to this Prophet \\n     (i.e. embrace Islam).\\'\\n\\n\\n     (On hearing the views of Heraclius) the people ran towards the gates \\n     of the palace like onagers but found the doors closed. Heraclius \\n     realized their hatred towards Islam and when he lost the hope of their\\n     embracing Islam, he ordered that they should be brought back in \\n     audience.\\n\\n\\n     (When they returned) he said, \\'What already said was just to test the \\n     strength of your conviction and I have seen it.\\' The people prostrated\\n     before him and became pleased with him, and this was the end of \\n     Heraclius\\'s story (in connection with his faith).\\n \\n\\n     I replied, \\'No.\\'\\n\\n\\n     He said, \\'Was anybody amongst his ancestors a king?\\'\\n\\n\\n     I replied, \\'No.\\'\\n\\n\\n     Heraclius asked, \\'Do the nobles or the poor follow him?\\'\\n\\n\\n     I replied, \\'It is the poor who follow him.\\'\\n\\n\\n     He said, \\'Are his followers increasing decreasing (day by day)?\\'\\n\\n\\n     I replied, \\'They are increasing.\\'\\n\\n\\n     He then asked, \\'Does anybody amongst those who embrace his religion \\n     become displeased and renounce the religion afterwards?\\'\\n\\n\\n     I replied, \\'No.\\'\\n\\n\\n     Heraclius said, \\'Have you ever accused him of telling lies before his \\n     claim (to be a Prophet)?\\'\\n\\n\\n     I replied, \\'No. \\'\\n\\n\\n     Heraclius said, \\'Does he break his promises?\\'\\n\\n\\n     I replied, \\'No. We are at truce with him but we do not know what he \\n     will do in it.\\' I could not find opportunity to say anything against \\n     him except that.\\n\\n\\n     Heraclius asked, \\'Have you ever had a war with him?\\'\\n\\n\\n     I replied, \\'Yes.\\'\\n\\n\\n     Then he said, \\'What was the outcome of the battles?\\'\\n\\n\\n     I replied, \\'Sometimes he was victorious and sometimes we.\\'\\n\\n\\n     Heraclius said, \\'What does he order you to do?\\'\\n\\n\\n     I said, \\'He tells us to worship Allah and Allah alone and not to \\n     worship anything along with Him, and to renounce all that our \\n     ancestors had said.

In fact all the Apostles come from noble families \\n     amongst their respective peoples. I questioned you whether anybody \\n     else amongst you claimed such a thing, your reply was in the negative.\\n     If the answer had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that \\n     this man was following the previous man\\'s statement. Then I asked you \\n     whether anyone of his ancestors was a king. Your reply was in the \\n     negative, and if it had been in the affirmative, I would have thought \\n     that this man wanted to take back his ancestral kingdom.\\n\\n\\n     I further asked whether he was ever accused of telling lies before he \\n     said what he said, and your reply was in the negative. So I wondered \\n     how a person who does not tell a lie about others could ever tell a \\n     lie about Allah. I, then asked you whether the rich people followed \\n     him or the poor. You replied that it was the poor who followed him. \\n     And in fact all the Apostle have been followed by this very class of \\n     people. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or \\n     decreasing. You replied that they were increasing, and in fact this is\\n     the way of true faith, till it is complete in all respects. I further \\n     asked you whether there was anybody, who, after embracing his \\n     religion, became displeased and discarded his religion. Your reply was\\n     in the negative, and in fact this is (the sign of) true faith, when \\n     its delight enters the hearts and mixes with them completely. I asked \\n     you whether he had ever betrayed. You replied in the negative and \\n     likewise the Apostles never betray. Then I asked you what he ordered \\n     you to do. You replied that he ordered you to worship Allah and Allah \\n     alone and not to worship any thing along with Him and forbade you to \\n     worship idols and ordered you to pray, to speak the truth and to be \\n     chaste. If what you have said is true, he will very soon occupy this \\n     place underneath my feet and I knew it (from the scriptures) that he \\n     was going to appear but I did not know that he would be from you, and \\n     if I could reach him definitely, I would go immediately to meet him \\n     and if I were with him, I would certainly wash his feet.\\' Heraclius \\n     then asked for the letter addressed by Allah\\'s Apostle\\n\\n\\n     which was delivered by Dihya to the Governor of Busra, who forwarded \\n     it to Heraclius to read. The contents of the letter were as follows: \\n     \"In the name of Allah the Beneficent, the Merciful (This letter is) \\n     from Muhammad the slave of Allah and His Apostle to Heraclius the \\n     ruler of Byzantine.

Heraclius then left for Homs. \\n     (a town in Syrian and stayed there till he received the reply of his \\n     letter from his friend who agreed with him in his opinion about the \\n     emergence of the Prophet (ﷺ) and the fact that he was a Prophet. On that \\n     Heraclius invited all the heads of the Byzantines to assemble in his \\n     palace at Homs. When they assembled, he ordered that all the doors of \\n     his palace be closed. Then he came out and said, \\'O Byzantines! If \\n     success is your desire and if you seek right guidance and want your \\n     empire to remain then give a pledge of allegiance to this Prophet \\n     (i.e. embrace Islam).\\'\\n\\n\\n     (On hearing the views of Heraclius) the people ran towards the gates \\n     of the palace like onagers but found the doors closed. Heraclius \\n     realized their hatred towards Islam and when he lost the hope of their\\n     embracing Islam, he ordered that they should be brought back in \\n     audience.\\n\\n\\n     (When they returned) he said, \\'What already said was just to test the \\n     strength of your conviction and I have seen it.\\' The people prostrated\\n     before him and became pleased with him, and this was the end of \\n     Heraclius\\'s story (in connection with his faith).\\n \\n\\n     Heraclius asked, \\'Do the nobles or the poor follow him?\\'\\n\\n\\n     I replied, \\'It is the poor who follow him.\\'\\n\\n\\n     He said, \\'Are his followers increasing decreasing (day by day)?\\'\\n\\n\\n     I replied, \\'They are increasing.\\'\\n\\n\\n     He then asked, \\'Does anybody amongst those who embrace his religion \\n     become displeased and renounce the religion afterwards?\\'\\n\\n\\n     I replied, \\'No.\\'\\n\\n\\n     Heraclius said, \\'Have you ever accused him of telling lies before his \\n     claim (to be a Prophet)?\\'\\n\\n\\n     I replied, \\'No. \\'\\n\\n\\n     Heraclius said, \\'Does he break his promises?\\'\\n\\n\\n     I replied, \\'No. We are at truce with him but we do not know what he \\n     will do in it.\\' I could not find opportunity to say anything against \\n     him except that.\\n\\n\\n     Heraclius asked, \\'Have you ever had a war with him?\\'\\n\\n\\n     I replied, \\'Yes.\\'\\n\\n\\n     Then he said, \\'What was the outcome of the battles?\\'\\n\\n\\n     I replied, \\'Sometimes he was victorious and sometimes we.\\'\\n\\n\\n     Heraclius said, \\'What does he order you to do?\\'\\n\\n\\n     I said, \\'He tells us to worship Allah and Allah alone and not to \\n     worship anything along with Him, and to renounce all that our \\n     ancestors had said.

In fact all the Apostles come from noble families \\n     amongst their respective peoples. I questioned you whether anybody \\n     else amongst you claimed such a thing, your reply was in the negative.\\n     If the answer had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that \\n     this man was following the previous man\\'s statement. Then I asked you \\n     whether anyone of his ancestors was a king. Your reply was in the \\n     negative, and if it had been in the affirmative, I would have thought \\n     that this man wanted to take back his ancestral kingdom.\\n\\n\\n     I further asked whether he was ever accused of telling lies before he \\n     said what he said, and your reply was in the negative. So I wondered \\n     how a person who does not tell a lie about others could ever tell a \\n     lie about Allah. I, then asked you whether the rich people followed \\n     him or the poor. You replied that it was the poor who followed him. \\n     And in fact all the Apostle have been followed by this very class of \\n     people. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or \\n     decreasing. You replied that they were increasing, and in fact this is\\n     the way of true faith, till it is complete in all respects. I further \\n     asked you whether there was anybody, who, after embracing his \\n     religion, became displeased and discarded his religion. Your reply was\\n     in the negative, and in fact this is (the sign of) true faith, when \\n     its delight enters the hearts and mixes with them completely. I asked \\n     you whether he had ever betrayed. You replied in the negative and \\n     likewise the Apostles never betray. Then I asked you what he ordered \\n     you to do. You replied that he ordered you to worship Allah and Allah \\n     alone and not to worship any thing along with Him and forbade you to \\n     worship idols and ordered you to pray, to speak the truth and to be \\n     chaste. If what you have said is true, he will very soon occupy this \\n     place underneath my feet and I knew it (from the scriptures) that he \\n     was going to appear but I did not know that he would be from you, and \\n     if I could reach him definitely, I would go immediately to meet him \\n     and if I were with him, I would certainly wash his feet.\\' Heraclius \\n     then asked for the letter addressed by Allah\\'s Apostle\\n\\n\\n     which was delivered by Dihya to the Governor of Busra, who forwarded \\n     it to Heraclius to read. The contents of the letter were as follows: \\n     \"In the name of Allah the Beneficent, the Merciful (This letter is) \\n     from Muhammad the slave of Allah and His Apostle to Heraclius the \\n     ruler of Byzantine.

Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or \\n     decreasing. You replied that they were increasing, and in fact this is\\n     the way of true faith, till it is complete in all respects. I further \\n     asked you whether there was anybody, who, after embracing his \\n     religion, became displeased and discarded his religion. Your reply was\\n     in the negative, and in fact this is (the sign of) true faith, when \\n     its delight enters the hearts and mixes with them completely. I asked \\n     you whether he had ever betrayed. You replied in the negative and \\n     likewise the Apostles never betray. Then I asked you what he ordered \\n     you to do. You replied that he ordered you to worship Allah and Allah \\n     alone and not to worship any thing along with Him and forbade you to \\n     worship idols and ordered you to pray, to speak the truth and to be \\n     chaste. If what you have said is true, he will very soon occupy this \\n     place underneath my feet and I knew it (from the scriptures) that he \\n     was going to appear but I did not know that he would be from you, and \\n     if I could reach him definitely, I would go immediately to meet him \\n     and if I were with him, I would certainly wash his feet.\\' Heraclius \\n     then asked for the letter addressed by Allah\\'s Apostle\\n\\n\\n     which was delivered by Dihya to the Governor of Busra, who forwarded \\n     it to Heraclius to read.

You replied that he ordered you to worship Allah and Allah \\n     alone and not to worship any thing along with Him and forbade you to \\n     worship idols and ordered you to pray, to speak the truth and to be \\n     chaste. If what you have said is true, he will very soon occupy this \\n     place underneath my feet and I knew it (from the scriptures) that he \\n     was going to appear but I did not know that he would be from you, and \\n     if I could reach him definitely, I would go immediately to meet him \\n     and if I were with him, I would certainly wash his feet.\\' Heraclius \\n     then asked for the letter addressed by Allah\\'s Apostle\\n\\n\\n     which was delivered by Dihya to the Governor of Busra, who forwarded \\n     it to Heraclius to read.

Then I started to become sure that he (the Prophet) would be the \\n     conqueror in the near future till I embraced Islam (i.e. Allah guided \\n     me to it).\"\\n\\n\\n     The sub narrator adds, \"Ibn An-Natur was the Governor of llya\\' \\n     (Jerusalem) and Heraclius was the head of the Christians of Sham. Ibn \\n     An-Natur narrates that once while Heraclius was visiting ilya\\' \\n     (Jerusalem), he got up in the morning with a sad mood. Some of his \\n     priests asked him why he was in that mood? Heraclius was a foreteller \\n     and an astrologer. He replied, \\'At night when I looked at the stars, I\\n     saw that the leader of those who practice circumcision had appeared \\n     (become the conqueror). Who are they who practice circumcision?\\' The \\n     people replied, \\'Except the Jews nobody practices circumcision, so you\\n     should not be afraid of them (Jews).\\n\\n\\n     \\'Just Issue orders to kill every Jew present in the country.\\'\\n\\n\\n     While they were discussing it, a messenger sent by the king of Ghassan\\n     to convey the news of Allah\\'s Messenger (ﷺ) to Heraclius was brought in. \\n     Having heard the news, he (Heraclius) ordered the people to go and see\\n     whether the messenger of Ghassan was circumcised. The people, after \\n     seeing him, told Heraclius that he was circumcised. Heraclius then \\n     asked him about the Arabs. The messenger replied, \\'Arabs also practice\\n     circumcision.\\'\\n\\n\\n     (After hearing that) Heraclius remarked that sovereignty of the \\'Arabs\\n     had appeared. Heraclius then wrote a letter to his friend in Rome who \\n     was as good as Heraclius in knowledge. Heraclius then left for Homs. \\n     (a town in Syrian and stayed there till he received the reply of his \\n     letter from his friend who agreed with him in his opinion about the \\n     emergence of the Prophet (ﷺ) and the fact that he was a Prophet. On that \\n     Heraclius invited all the heads of the Byzantines to assemble in his \\n     palace at Homs. When they assembled, he ordered that all the doors of \\n     his palace be closed. Then he came out and said, \\'O Byzantines! If \\n     success is your desire and if you seek right guidance and want your \\n     empire to remain then give a pledge of allegiance to this Prophet \\n     (i.e. embrace Islam).\\'\\n\\n\\n     (On hearing the views of Heraclius) the people ran towards the gates \\n     of the palace like onagers but found the doors closed. Heraclius \\n     realized their hatred towards Islam and when he lost the hope of their\\n     embracing Islam, he ordered that they should be brought back in \\n     audience.\\n\\n\\n     (When they returned) he said, \\'What already said was just to test the \\n     strength of your conviction and I have seen it.\\' The people prostrated\\n     before him and became pleased with him, and this was the end of \\n     Heraclius\\'s story (in connection with his faith).\\n \\n\\n     Heraclius asked, \\'Have you ever had a war with him?\\'\\n\\n\\n     I replied, \\'Yes.\\'\\n\\n\\n     Then he said, \\'What was the outcome of the battles?\\'\\n\\n\\n     I replied, \\'Sometimes he was victorious and sometimes we.\\'\\n\\n\\n     Heraclius said, \\'What does he order you to do?\\'\\n\\n\\n     I said, \\'He tells us to worship Allah and Allah alone and not to \\n     worship anything along with Him, and to renounce all that our \\n     ancestors had said. He orders us to pray, to speak the truth, to be \\n     chaste and to keep good relations with our Kith and kin.\\'\\n\\n\\n     Heraclius asked the translator to convey to me the following, I asked \\n     you about his family and your reply was that he belonged to a very \\n     noble family. In fact all the Apostles come from noble families \\n     amongst their respective peoples. I questioned you whether anybody \\n     else amongst you claimed such a thing, your reply was in the negative.\\n     If the answer had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that \\n     this man was following the previous man\\'s statement. Then I asked you \\n     whether anyone of his ancestors was a king. Your reply was in the \\n     negative, and if it had been in the affirmative, I would have thought \\n     that this man wanted to take back his ancestral kingdom.\\n\\n\\n     I further asked whether he was ever accused of telling lies before he \\n     said what he said, and your reply was in the negative. So I wondered \\n     how a person who does not tell a lie about others could ever tell a \\n     lie about Allah. I, then asked you whether the rich people followed \\n     him or the poor. You replied that it was the poor who followed him. \\n     And in fact all the Apostle have been followed by this very class of \\n     people. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or \\n     decreasing. You replied that they were increasing, and in fact this is\\n     the way of true faith, till it is complete in all respects. I further \\n     asked you whether there was anybody, who, after embracing his \\n     religion, became displeased and discarded his religion. Your reply was\\n     in the negative, and in fact this is (the sign of) true faith, when \\n     its delight enters the hearts and mixes with them completely. I asked \\n     you whether he had ever betrayed. You replied in the negative and \\n     likewise the Apostles never betray. Then I asked you what he ordered \\n     you to do. You replied that he ordered you to worship Allah and Allah \\n     alone and not to worship any thing along with Him and forbade you to \\n     worship idols and ordered you to pray, to speak the truth and to be \\n     chaste. If what you have said is true, he will very soon occupy this \\n     place underneath my feet and I knew it (from the scriptures) that he \\n     was going to appear but I did not know that he would be from you, and \\n     if I could reach him definitely, I would go immediately to meet him \\n     and if I were with him, I would certainly wash his feet.\\' Heraclius \\n     then asked for the letter addressed by Allah\\'s Apostle\\n\\n\\n     which was delivered by Dihya to the Governor of Busra, who forwarded \\n     it to Heraclius to read. The contents of the letter were as follows: \\n     \"In the name of Allah the Beneficent, the Merciful (This letter is) \\n     from Muhammad the slave of Allah and His Apostle to Heraclius the \\n     ruler of Byzantine.

Heraclius \\n     realized their hatred towards Islam and when he lost the hope of their\\n     embracing Islam, he ordered that they should be brought back in \\n     audience.\\n\\n\\n     (When they returned) he said, \\'What already said was just to test the \\n     strength of your conviction and I have seen it.\\' The people prostrated\\n     before him and became pleased with him, and this was the end of \\n     Heraclius\\'s story (in connection with his faith).\\n \\n\\n     I further asked whether he was ever accused of telling lies before he \\n     said what he said, and your reply was in the negative. So I wondered \\n     how a person who does not tell a lie about others could ever tell a \\n     lie about Allah. I, then asked you whether the rich people followed \\n     him or the poor. You replied that it was the poor who followed him. \\n     And in fact all the Apostle have been followed by this very class of \\n     people. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or \\n     decreasing. You replied that they were increasing, and in fact this is\\n     the way of true faith, till it is complete in all respects. I further \\n     asked you whether there was anybody, who, after embracing his \\n     religion, became displeased and discarded his religion. Your reply was\\n     in the negative, and in fact this is (the sign of) true faith, when \\n     its delight enters the hearts and mixes with them completely. I asked \\n     you whether he had ever betrayed. You replied in the negative and \\n     likewise the Apostles never betray. Then I asked you what he ordered \\n     you to do. You replied that he ordered you to worship Allah and Allah \\n     alone and not to worship any thing along with Him and forbade you to \\n     worship idols and ordered you to pray, to speak the truth and to be \\n     chaste. If what you have said is true, he will very soon occupy this \\n     place underneath my feet and I knew it (from the scriptures) that he \\n     was going to appear but I did not know that he would be from you, and \\n     if I could reach him definitely, I would go immediately to meet him \\n     and if I were with him, I would certainly wash his feet.\\' Heraclius \\n     then asked for the letter addressed by Allah\\'s Apostle\\n\\n\\n     which was delivered by Dihya to the Governor of Busra, who forwarded \\n     it to Heraclius to read. The contents of the letter were as follows: \\n     \"In the name of Allah the Beneficent, the Merciful (This letter is) \\n     from Muhammad the slave of Allah and His Apostle to Heraclius the \\n     ruler of Byzantine.

       "  'description': 'Once we were traveling with the Prophet (ﷺ) and we carried on traveling till the last part of the night and \\nthen we (halted at a place) and slept (deeply). There is nothing sweeter than sleep for a traveler in the \\nlast part of the night. So it was only the heat of the sun that made us to wake up and the first to wake \\nup was so and so, then so and so and then so and so (the narrator `Auf said that Abu Raja\\' had told \\nhim their names but he had forgotten them) and the fourth person to wake up was `Umar bin Al- \\nKhattab. And whenever the Prophet (ﷺ) used to sleep, nobody would wake up him till he himself used to \\nget up as we did not know what was happening (being revealed) to him in his sleep. So, `Umar got up \\nand saw the condition of the people, and he was a strict man, so he said, \"Allahu Akbar\" and raised his \\nvoice with Takbir, and kept on saying loudly till the Prophet (ﷺ) got up because of it. When he got up, the \\npeople informed him about what had happened to them. He said, \"There is no harm (or it will not be \\nharmful). Depart!\" So they departed from that place, and after covering some distance the Prophet (ﷺ) \\nstopped and asked for some water to perform the ablution. So he performed the ablution and the call \\nfor the prayer was pronounced and he led the people in prayer. After he finished from the prayer, he \\nsaw a man sitting aloof who had not prayed with the people. He asked, \"O so and so! What has \\nprevented you from praying with us?\" He replied, \"I am Junub and there is no water. \" The Prophet (ﷺ) \\nsaid, \"Perform Tayammum with (clean) earth and that is sufficient for you.\" \\nThen the Prophet (ﷺ) proceeded on and the people complained to him of thirst. Thereupon he got down \\nand called a person (the narrator `Auf added that Abu Raja\\' had named him but he had forgotten) and \\n`Ali, and ordered them to go and bring water. So they went in search of water and met a woman who \\nwas sitting on her camel between two bags of water. They asked, \"Where can we find water?\" She \\nreplied, \"I was there (at the place of water) this hour yesterday and my people are behind me.\" They \\nrequested her to accompany them. She asked, \"Where?\" They said, \"To Allah\\'s Messenger (ﷺ) .\" She said, \\n\"Do you mean the man who is called the Sabi, (with a new religion)?\" They replied, \"Yes, the same \\nperson. So come along.\" They brought her to the Prophet (ﷺ) and narrated the whole story. He said, \"Help \\nher to dismount.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) asked for a pot, then he opened the mouths of the bags and poured \\nsome water into the pot. Then he closed the big openings of the bags and opened the small ones and \\nthe people were called upon to drink and water their animals. \\nSo they all watered their animals and they (too) all quenched their thirst and also gave water to others \\nand last of all the Prophet (ﷺ) gave a pot full of water to the person who was Junub and told him to pour it \\nover his body. The woman was standing and watching all that which they were doing with her water. \\nBy Allah, when her water bags were returned the looked like as if they were more full (of water) than \\nthey had been before (Miracle of Allah\\'s Messenger (ﷺ)) Then the Prophet (ﷺ) ordered us to collect something \\nfor her; so dates, flour and Sawiq were collected which amounted to a good meal that was put in a \\npiece of cloth. She was helped to ride on her camel and that cloth full of foodstuff was also placed in \\nfront of her and then the Prophet (ﷺ) said to her, \"We have not taken your water but Allah has given water \\nto us.\" She returned home late. Her relatives asked her: \"O so and so what has delayed you?\" She said, \\n\"A strange thing! Two men met me and took me to the man who is called the Sabi\\' and he did such \\nand such a thing. By Allah, he is either the greatest magician between this and this (gesturing with her \\nindex and middle fingers raising them towards the sky indicating the heaven and the earth) or he is \\nAllah\\'s true Apostle.\" \\nAfterwards the Muslims used to attack the pagans around her abode but never touched her village. \\nOne day she said to her people, \"I think that these people leave you purposely. Have you got any \\ninclination to Islam?\" They obeyed her and all of them embraced Islam. \\nAbu `Abdullah said: The word Saba\\'a means \"The one who has deserted his old religion and embraced \\na new religion.\" Abul \\'Ailya [??] said, \"The S`Abis are a sect of people of the Scripture who recite the \\nBook of Psalms.\"',\n",

Then he sent for Bani An-Najjar and they came \\narmed with their swords. As if I am looking (just now) as the Prophet (ﷺ) was sitting over his Rahila \\n(Mount) with Abu Bakr riding behind him and all Banu An-Najjar around him till he dismounted at \\nthe courtyard of Abu Aiyub\\'s house. The Prophet (ﷺ) loved to pray wherever the time for the prayer was \\ndue even at sheep-folds. Later on he ordered that a mosque should be built and sent for some people of \\nBanu-An-Najjar and said, \"O Banu An-Najjar! Suggest to me the price of this (walled) piece of land \\nof yours.\" They replied, \"No! By Allah! We do not demand its price except from Allah.\" Anas added: \\nThere were graves of pagans in it and some of it was unleveled and there were some date-palm trees \\nin it. The Prophet (ﷺ) ordered that the graves of the pagans be dug out and the unleveled land be level led \\nand the date-palm trees be cut down . (So all that was done). They aligned these cut date-palm trees \\ntowards the Qibla of the mosque (as a wall) and they also built two stone side-walls (of the mosque). \\nHis companions brought the stones while reciting some poetic verses. The Prophet (ﷺ) was with them and \\nhe kept on saying, \"There is no goodness except that of the Hereafter, O Allah! So please forgive the \\nAnsars and the emigrants. \"',\n",

So some of them will follow the sun, some will follow the moon, and some will follow other \\ndeities; and only this nation (Muslims) will be left with its hypocrites. Allah will come to them and \\nsay, \\'I am Your Lord.\\' They will say, \\'We shall stay in this place till our Lord comes to us and when \\nour Lord will come, we will recognize Him. Then Allah will come to them again and say, \\'I am your \\nLord.\\' They will say, \\'You are our Lord.\\' Allah will call them, and As-Sirat (a bridge) will be laid \\nacross Hell and I (Muhammad) shall be the first amongst the Apostles to cross it with my followers. \\nNobody except the Apostles will then be able to speak and they will be saying then, \\'O Allah!

I said to him, \"By Allah, you have changed (the Prophet\\'s \\ntradition).\" He replied, \"O Abu Sa`id! Gone is that which you know.\" I said, \"By Allah! What I know \\nis better than what I do not know.\" Marwan said, \"People do not sit to listen to our Khutba after the \\nprayer, so I delivered the Khutba before the prayer.\"',\n",

So the Prophet (ﷺ) I recited the Holy verses of Sirat-Ad-Dukhan: \\'Then watch you For \\nthe day that The sky will Bring forth a kind Of smoke Plainly visible.\\' (44.10) When the famine was \\ntaken off, the people renegade once again as nonbelievers. The statement of Allah, (in Sura \"Ad- \\nDukhan\"-44) refers to that: \\'On the day when We shall seize You with a mighty grasp.\\' (44.16) And \\nthat was what happened on the day of the battle of Badr.\" Asbath added on the authority of Mansur, \\n\"Allah\\'s Messenger (ﷺ) prayed for them and it rained heavily for seven days. So the people complained of the \\nexcessive rain. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \\'O Allah! (Let it rain) around us and not on us.\\' So the clouds \\ndispersed over his head and it rained over the surroundings.\"',\n",
