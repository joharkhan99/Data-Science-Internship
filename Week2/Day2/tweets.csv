20,@kamran_imam @not_ghuf @mobeen_hameed Sehat Card was a good way to divert funds for a good cause but the elite want to use it for themselves. There is always budget for their adventures but nothing for people.
21,@not_ghuf @mobeen_hameed The issue with price caps was also that the gov had no negotiation power. Hospitals could just blackmail the government to either raise the price cap or they won't accept sehat card. That's what you get when you privatize a necessary service to an oligopolist market ...
